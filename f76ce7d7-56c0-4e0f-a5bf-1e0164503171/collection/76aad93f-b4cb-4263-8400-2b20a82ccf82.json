The test should not pass if the response time is greater than or equal to 1000ms.\n1. **Add a second test**: Let's use Google's [PageSpeed API](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started) to evaluate our webpage scores. Add a second request, called `lighthouse`:\n  - `GET` request method\n  - `https://www.googleapis.com/pagespeedonline/v5/runPagespeed` request URL\n  - Query parameter `url` with a value of <code>\\{{url\\}}</code>\n  - Add a test to assert the PageSpeed API gives our webpage a lighthouse performance score of at least `90` - so the test should pass if the score is between 90 and 100.\n\nFor both requests, it's okay for the tests you write to fail. Just be sure you're testing the responses properly.\n\nOnce you complete these steps, move on to the next folder in this collection to submit your solution.
