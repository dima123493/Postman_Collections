Step through the workflow by running each request one at a time to ensure you are getting and setting the variables properly and passing the data correctly.\n1. **Run the collection**: Once you think you have it, run this folder using the [collection runner](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/) to make sure there are no errors in the folder. If you want to run the entire collection instead of the folder, add [`postman.setNextRequest(null)`](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/building-workflows/) under the **Tests** tab of the second request to stop the collection run from continuing on to the next folder. Remember to save your changes.\n  \nOnce you complete these steps, move on to the next folder in this collection to submit your solution.
